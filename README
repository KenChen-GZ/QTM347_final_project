## Polish Company Bankruptcy Prediction

### Introduction

**Background:** Research on predicting bankruptcy has been crucial in economics for nearly a century.

**Objective:** To develop a model to predict a companyâ€™s financial health using various economic indicators.

**Historical Approaches:** Earlier focus was on statistical hypothesis testing and modeling, with recent shifts towards artificial intelligence.

**Project Focus:** This project applies contemporary machine learning (ML) methods to enhance prediction accuracy.

### Source

**Dataset:** Polish Companies Bankruptcy
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Description:** This dataset focuses on the prediction of bankruptcy for Polish companies.
- **Time Frame:** Bankrupt companies from 2000 to 2012, operating companies from 2007 to 2013.
- **Purpose:** To develop models that can accurately predict the financial health and potential bankruptcy of companies based on historical data.

### Data Setup

1. Drop Missing Values
2. Split into Test and Train sets
3. Target Variable: Bankruptcy (Binomial)
4. Feature Variables: A1-A64 (Numerical)

### Methodology

#### Logistic Regression
- **Technique:** Subset Selection Cross-validation

### Discussion

1. **Variable Importance:** The predictors selected by the two models do not overlap, raising questions about which variables are most critical in predicting bankruptcy.
2. **Recall Rate:** Although model accuracy is high, the recall rate is low, indicating failure in identifying the majority of positive cases (bankruptcy).
3. **Correlation Between Variables:** Potential correlations may exist between variables.
4. **Multicollinearity:** All 64 features are transformations of basic indexes like gross profit, total liability, and book value. Treating them as individual predictors may lead to severe multicollinearity issues, suggesting a need for alternative methods or calculations.
